# PicoCalc uLisp Machine
A version of uLisp to convert the Clockwork Pi PicoCalc into a self-contained handheld Lisp computer. The files are as follows:

* ulisp-picocalc.ino - the uLisp source file, to be compiled and uploaded using the Arduino IDE.
* ulisp-picocalc-comments.ino - identical but including comprehensive comments.
* ulisp-picocalc.uf2 - a pre-built image you can upload by copying onto the Raspberry Pi Pico UF2 disk.
* Alternative UF2 images - a folder containing alternative images for other boards.
* Setup60_RP2040_ILI9488.h - a file needed for compiling uLisp; see the instructions in the link below.
